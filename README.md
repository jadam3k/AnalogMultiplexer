# Analog Multiplexer Project

This is a simple **analog multiplexer** I put together. It lets me connect a bunch of analog components, like sensors, to just one input on a microcontroller.  
I made it mostly as a learning exercise while getting more comfortable with how multiplexers work in real life.
